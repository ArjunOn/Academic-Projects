## Example data: Michigan flights

```{r}
michiganFlights <- read_rds("fullMiFlights2021.rds")
```

What type of object is michiganFlights? What is its length?

It is a `list` with 22520240 bytes.

```{r}
# Create tibbles in environment from list
list2env(michiganFlights, envir = .GlobalEnv)
```

```{r}
skim(airlines)

skim(airports)

skim(flights)

skim(planes)

skim(weather)

```

**Suppose we wanted to draw (approximately) the route each plane flies from its origin to its destination. Which variables would we need? Which tables would we need to combine?**

flights(origin,dest) and airports(name,lat,long)


**Now suppose we wanted to explore typical weather patterns for departing flights at different airports and explore the weatherâ€™s relationship with departure delays. Considering the wind speeds and amount of precipitation, which variables would we need for this? Which tables would we need to combine?**

weather and flights

## Outer joins

**Combine the flights and airlines data frames with left_join() to create a new data set called flightsCarriers.**

```{r}
flightsCarriers <- flights |>
  left_join(airlines)

```

**Calculate the average flight distance for each carrier using the full name of the carriers. Who had the longest flights on average? Who had the shortest?**

```{r}
flights|>
  left_join(airlines) |>
  group_by(name) |>
  summarise(AVG_DISTANCE = mean(distance)) |>
  arrange(desc(AVG_DISTANCE))
```

**Combine the weather and flights data frames with left_join() to create a new data set called weatherFlights. How many rows does weatherFlights have? Hint: First fix an issue with the time_hour variable using the code below.**

```{r}
# Fixing time_hour variable in weather data set
weather <-  weather |> 
  mutate(time_hour = lubridate::make_datetime(year, month, day, hour))
```

```{r}
weatherFlights <- weather |>
  left_join(flights)
nrow(weatherFlights)
```

**Combine the flights and weather data frames with left_join() to create a new data set called flightsWeather. How many rows does flightsWeather have?**

```{r}

flightsweather <- flights |>
  left_join(weather, by = c("year" = "year",
                            "month" = "month",
                            "day" = "day",
                            "hour" = "hour",
                            "origin" = "origin"))
nrow(flightsweather)
```


**Combine the weather and flights data frames with full_join() to create a new data set called weatherFlightsFull. How many rows does weatherFlightsFull have?**

```{r}
weatherFlightsFull <- weather |>
  full_join(flights)
```

**Considering all of the data we have available, how many flights have missing wind speeds?**

```{r}
flightsweather |> pull(wind_speed) |> is.na() |> sum()

```

## Inner Joins

**Combine the weather and flights data frames with inner_join() to create a new data set called innerWeatherFlights. How many rows does innerWeatherFlights have?**

```{r}
innerWeatherFlights <- inner_join(weather,flights)
nrow(innerWeatherFlights)
nrow(weatherFlights)
```
## Bonus (Optional)

**Create a heatmap calendar with R using the calendR package and the code below.**

```{r}
library(calendR)

# Calculating number of flights for each date
nFlights <- flights |> 
  dplyr::count(year, month, day) |> 
  arrange(year, month, day)

# Creating heatmap calendar of number of flights
flights_calendar <- calendR(year = 2021,
                            title = "Flights out of major Michigan airports, 2021",
        special.days = nFlights$n,
        gradient = TRUE,
        monthnames = month.name,
        months.size = 11,
        weeknames.size = 3.3,
        legend.pos = "bottom",
        legend.title = "Number of flights",
        ncol = 3,
        margin = 1) +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "dodgerblue",
  guide = guide_colorbar(frame.colour = "black", 
                                               ticks.colour = "black",
                         title.position = "top")) +
  theme(legend.title = )

# Saving plot
size_mult <- 22
ggsave(plot = flights_calendar,
       filename = "calendar_plot.png",
       units = "mm",
       dpi = 120,
       width = 7*size_mult,
       height = 8.5*size_mult)

knitr::include_graphics("calendar_plot.png")
```
