## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r scatter}
# Install the tidyverse package if needed
if(!("tidyverse" %in% installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("tidyverse")
}

# Load the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)
 
# Load the cars data set
data(cars)

# Scatterplot type 1

plot(cars$speed, cars$dist, main="Observation of Cars", xlab="Car Speed", ylab="Car Distance")

# Scatterplot type 2
cars %>%
ggplot(aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + geom_point()
```
