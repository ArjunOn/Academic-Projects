#### Installing necessary packages

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(flextable)
library(janitor)
library(broom)

```

#### We can set default theme settings for plots, and load some functions to simplify table customization and creation using the code below.

```{r}
# Set ggplot theme for visualizations
theme_set(ggthemes::theme_few())

# Set options for flextables
set_flextable_defaults(na_str = "NA")

# Load function for printing tables nicely
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dilernia/STA323/main/Functions/make_flex.R")
```

#### Letâ€™s import data from the website GitHub to use for this activity, and print 7 randomly selected rows from the data.

```{r}
# Importing data from course GitHub page
possums <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dilernia/STA323/main/Data/possum.csv")

set.seed(1994)

# Printing sample of 7 rows from data set
possums %>%  
  dplyr::sample_n(size = 7) %>% 
  make_flex(caption = "Randomly selected people who were aboard the Titanic.")
```



```{r}
# Creating contingency table

contingencyTable2 <- possums %>% 

 janitor::tabyl(var1 = region, var2 = sex)



# Calculating confidence interval for p1 - p2

possum_sex_counts <- contingencyTable2 %>% 

 dplyr::filter(region %in% c("New South Wales / Queensland", "Victoria")) %>% 

 dplyr::select(c("Female", "Male"))



diff_possum_CI <- prop.test(x = as.matrix(possum_sex_counts),

               n = colSums(possum_sex_counts),

               conf.level = 0.95,

               correct = FALSE)
# Printing table
contingencyTable2 %>% 
  make_flex(caption = "95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportion of possums who are female in the New South Wales / Queensland region compared to the Victoria region", ndigits = 0)

diff_possum_CI %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  make_flex(caption = "Confidence interval for proportion of 3rd-class passengers who survived on the Titanic",
            ndigits = 3)
```

```{r}

# Implementing a chi-square test of independence
chi2Res <- chisq.test(contingencyTable2, tabyl_results = TRUE)
# Printing table
chi2Res$expected %>% 
  make_flex(caption = "Expected counts for survival status by passenger class", ndigits = 1)


# Printing model output
chi2Res %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  make_flex(caption = "Results of the chi-square test of independence",
            ndigits = 2)
```

```{r}
